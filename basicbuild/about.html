 <h1>About This Project</h1>

  <p>This project is about sharing how I see the world through colors, images, and moments in everyday life. Each page highlights a part of my perspective and favorite things, while also giving you a sense of the stories and emotions behind them. My goal is to invite you into the way I notice and experience the world, turning everyday details into something meaningful through photography.</p>
