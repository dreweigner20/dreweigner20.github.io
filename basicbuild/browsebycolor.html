  <h1>What does photography mean to you?</h1>

  <p>
    I grew up with a camera in my hand, so I never really thought of myself as an artist or photographer. 
    My mom would host fashion shows for high-end brands through a nonprofit, and that’s where my love for photography started. 
    I’ve always loved pictures, so I naturally found myself in the background—moving around, capturing moments, and staying busy. 
    That’s how I fell in love with photography.

  <h2>What's your favorite color?</h2>
  <p>
    Personally, I don't have just one favorite color—I love blue, orange, and green. 
    Colors can influence how we feel, spark emotions, and shape how we see the world.
